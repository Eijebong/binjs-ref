//! A reference implementation for the BinJS binary source format for JavaScript.
//!
//! # About BinJS
//!
//! As websites become more sophisticated, the amount of JavaScript source code keeps
//! increasing. By itself, this is not a problem. However, with the amount of code
//! loaded by large websites such as Facebook's chat, it is now common to witness
//! page loads during which both the loading and the parsing of JS code can take
//! several seconds each â€“ this is assuming a fast connection, and taking into
//! account that the code is both compressed and optimized for loading and parsing
//! speed.
//!
//! There is no reason to believe that the size of JS code will decrease or will
//! even stop increasing, nor that every large webdev team has the means to profile
//! loading and parsing speed of all their code.
//!
//! This crate offers a (WIP) reference implementation for BinJS, a vendor-neutral
//! JavaScript format designed to optimize parsing speed and, when possible,
//! loading speed.
//!
//!
//! # The format
//!
//! To simplify reading, specifications of the format are cut in three layers:
//!
//! - the AST (see module `ast`);
//! - the Token Streams (see module `token`);
//! - the Byte Streams (see module `bytes`).
